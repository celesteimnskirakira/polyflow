**Multiple models check the same thing. Consensus beats any single AI.**

Run any combination of AI models in parallel on the same task — they cross-validate each other, vote on findings, and synthesize a final answer. No single model's blind spots. Describe what you want in plain English, or write a YAML file.

```bash
pip install polyflow-ai
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...

# Use a built-in workflow
polyflow run code-review-multi-model -i "$(git diff HEAD~1)"

# Or generate one from natural language
polyflow new "multiple models audit my API for security issues, vote on findings"
```

Add to any repo as a GitHub Action — every PR reviewed automatically:

```yaml
- uses: celesteimnskirakira/polyflow@main
  with:
    workflow: code-review-multi-model
    input: ${{ steps.diff.outputs.content }}
    openrouter-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
```

## Why multiple models?

No model is right 100% of the time. But when multiple models **all agree**, that's a signal worth trusting. When they disagree, that's where the real problems are.

```
Single model:    Claude says "no security issues"   → might have blind spots

Multiple models: Claude says "no security issues"
                 Gemini finds SQL injection          → consensus surfaces the real finding
                 GPT-4 finds missing auth check
                 Claude synthesizes final report
```

This is **ensemble learning applied to developer workflows** — the same principle behind code review, peer review, and ML ensembles.

## Install

```bash
pip install polyflow-ai
```

Requires Python 3.11+. One key covers all models:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...    # openrouter.ai — 290+ models, one key
polyflow doctor                         # verify setup
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Browse 22 built-in workflows
polyflow list
polyflow list --tag security

# Run a workflow
polyflow run code-review-multi-model -i "$(git diff HEAD~1)"
polyflow run security-audit -i "$(cat src/auth.py)"
polyflow run bug-triage -i "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable"

# Generate a custom workflow from natural language
polyflow new "multiple models review my API design, vote on findings" -o api-review.yaml
polyflow run ./api-review.yaml -i "$(cat src/api.py)"

# Run headlessly in CI/CD
polyflow run <workflow> --ci -i "..."
```

---

## How It Works

Send the same prompt to multiple models in parallel, then aggregate:

```yaml
name: security-consensus

steps:
  - id: audit
    type: parallel
    steps:
      - id: claude
        model: claude
        prompt: "Find security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10): {{input}}"
      - id: gemini
        model: gemini
        prompt: "Find security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10): {{input}}"
      - id: gpt4
        model: gpt-4
        prompt: "Find security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10): {{input}}"
    aggregate:
      mode: vote       # only findings all models agree on
      model: claude    # Claude writes the final report
      prompt: |
        Multiple models independently audited this code.
        Mark consensus findings as HIGH CONFIDENCE, disagreements as NEEDS REVIEW.
        {{aggregated}}

output:
  format: markdown
  save_to: security-report.md
```

| Aggregate mode | When to use |
|---|---|
| `vote` | Highest confidence — only what all models agree on |
| `diff` | Show where models disagree — good for exploring trade-offs |
| `summary` | One model synthesizes all outputs into a single report |
| `raw` | Return all outputs separately |

Chain steps for sequential pipelines:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: find_issues
    type: parallel
    steps: [...]
    aggregate:
      mode: vote
      model: claude

  - id: generate_fix
    model: claude
    prompt: |
      Consensus issues: {{steps.find_issues.output}}
      Write a fix for each HIGH CONFIDENCE issue.
      Code: {{input}}
```

## Customize

### Use any model

Any [OpenRouter model ID](https://openrouter.ai/models) works directly in YAML:

```yaml
model: claude          # Claude Sonnet 4.6 (default)
model: gemini          # Gemini 2.0 Flash
model: gpt-4           # GPT-4o
model: claude-opus     # Claude Opus 4.6 (premium)
model: gpt-5           # GPT-5.4 (premium)
model: deepseek/deepseek-r2          # any OpenRouter model ID
model: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct
```

### Change the number of models

Edit the `steps` list inside a `type: parallel` block — add or remove sub-steps freely:

```yaml
- id: review
  type: parallel
  steps:
    - id: model_a
      model: claude
      prompt: "Review: {{input}}"
    - id: model_b
      model: gemini
      prompt: "Review: {{input}}"
    # add more models here
  aggregate:
    mode: diff
    model: claude
```

### Change aggregate mode

```yaml
aggregate:
  mode: vote       # vote | diff | summary | raw
  model: claude    # which model writes the synthesis (optional)
  prompt: |        # custom synthesis prompt (optional)
    Summarize findings. Mark consensus items as HIGH CONFIDENCE.
    {{aggregated}}
```

## Contributing

Workflows are plain YAML — no code required.

1. Fork the repo
2. Add your workflow to `workflows/examples/`
3. Validate: `polyflow validate your-workflow.yaml`
4. Open a PR

**The best contributions use at least two models** with aggregation — that's what makes Polyflow different from single-model tools.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
